Chapter Discussion:
 
TODOs Admin:
Anand creates Kanban and Adds Javed
Javed add anand to GIT Repo and shares links with anand to GIT and TOC
 
 
TODO Content
Anand is repsonsible for Part I
Javed is repsonsible for Part III
Anand does EDyn, QM for Part II;
Javed does Mechnaics and StatMech for Part II
 
 




Title ideas: Greens -Functios: Zero to Hero

TODO Javed:
TODO Anand: Reviewing code bases for Green's Functions 

First things first:

What needs to be clear:
Target Group:
Advanced Bachelor, Starting Master and above (Physics)
Theoretical Physicists beyond master


Applications ML:
Data-driven discovery of Greenâ€™s functions with human-understandable deep learning | Scientific Reports
How do we seperate people who know GF and those who don't --> We need to engage with other chapters

Zero to Hero in one book

Learning by doing: Exercises / Programs/Notebooks;  Have one code-base for numerics
--> Codebase TODO Anand
--> Possible contanct: https://www.aalto.fi/en/people/jose-lado
--> Maybe Vilas: https://3blue1brown.substack.com/p/simulating-phase-change
